# StudentManagementCPP
A student management system that uses linked list to insert, display, search, delete, update, and modify records.

Day 1:

I know this project aint that much but its a beginner project and its meant to learn ig.
I need to relearn the basic linked list operations in CPP that I learned in C.

1)Insert at beginning 
2)Insert at end
3)Insert at a specified position
4)Delete with roll no (includes delete at beginning, delete at end and delete at a specified position)
5)Display(Just linked list traversal)
6)Search(Just linked list traversal)
7)Updating(Searching with roll no and updating the given record)

so yeah these are all I have to learn.

After I complete this, I will focus on implementing skip list in the same project to help me search faster in log(n) time complexity.

Day 2:

After a 8 month hiatus of learning C++ and DSA, im actually gonna implement this thing for real now. And no skip list isnt what im gonna use, ill instead use something better.
